### Hi! Welcome to my GitHub
##

Back-end developer, proficient in Python with Django.
Python developer since 2023, improving application performance and integration, providing the best results and I have experience in developing with Django with websites that have more robust systems and Flask for microservices, possible performances within the development of a project. Within these projects I also integrate with Robotic Process Automation (RPA), Web Scraping with Selenium and integration with relational database PostgreSQL and NoSQL MongoDB.

My enthusiasm is not only for coding, but also for providing effective solutions to challenges that arise, being part of development teams, excelling in problem-solving and implementing solutions creatively and efficiently to add value and deliver the best possible results with maximum efficiency.

On my github you will find projects that I try to develop, always solving some current problem, from commerce to business. Feel free to explore my projects and contact me if you are interested in having more details!
